#Give Me A Game
A educative and test project to list all my video games build with the _Sensio Labs Silex_ Micro Framework

Under development

## Configuration
* In the class _src/Config/General_: change the website URL.
* In the class _src/Config/General_ : set your database credentials

## Notes
This is a test project to see what _Silex_ has under the hood. Below are a few things I could have done:
* Use the Doctrine Entity Repository
* Use the Symfony authentication component :

* Use the Silex built-in route in a more simple way espacially for the CRUD routes:
https://silex.symfony.com/doc/2.0/usage.html
* Use a proper error handler
